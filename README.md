# CNN and VGG16 Model Analysis

This project explores convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and applies the VGG16 architecture to analyze and classify image data. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for model training and an HTML page for visualization.

## Project Overview

- **CNN and VGG16 Models**: Implements CNNs and the pre-trained VGG16 model for image classification tasks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares performance metrics of the custom CNN and VGG16 model.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The project includes steps for loading and processing the image dataset.
- **Model Training**: Trains a custom CNN and fine-tunes the VGG16 model.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates both models based on accuracy, loss, and other metrics.

## Installation Instructions
